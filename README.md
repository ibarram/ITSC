## Abstract

The dataset contains the three-phase current signals measured from a squirrel-cage induction motor. The experimental tests were carried out for different fault levels in each winding phase; data was collected for a healthy state. The dataset consists of 13 categories: 12 inter-turn short-circuit faults per phase at 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, and healthy. Five repetitions were performed for each experimental condition; moreover, all measurements were collected in a steady state without load.
